## CPS 430 FIFA
This project was written to satisfy the semester project at the University of Dayton's CPS 430 - Database Management Systems class. 

The goal of the project was to demonstrate basic knowledge of relational databases, including constraints, keys, data-types, and SQL. The database presented here should be in 3rd-normal form.


This project was built on an ASP.NET Core backend, using Entity Framework Core as the ORM. The front-end was built on Angular.

The web app displays information about the United States' Football/Soccer team during the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
